        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. When a person goes to a web page like
          <b>http://www.google.com</b>, their computer sends a
          HTTP Request to a server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on
          the user's screen. This
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" >website</a>
          does a good job of explaining more.

      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup
      Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". This <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">link</a> directs you to a very informative site for  HTML Markup Language (HTML).

        Tags and Elements...

         <div class="concept.description">
        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML
          elements. When writing HTML, we
          tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML
          tags. This
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oGMxZEJqug">YouTube</a> video explains the distinction very well.

        Computers only do what you tell them...
      </div>
            <div class="concept.description">
        <p>
          Computers interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

      <b>We'll be looking into 'HTML, Python, CSS during this course</b><br><br>
Observing Wikipedia web page and structure, you can see that all elements are rectangular and you can read the same text as on the page SID- the triangle are an html element with an opening tag and a closing tag.<br><br>

<b>HTML</b> - HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.<br><br>

<b>CSS</b> - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.<br><br>

<b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.<br><br>

<b>Avoiding Code Repetition</b> - code repetition will often have negative consequences by making the programmer repeat code over and over again.  Typically this means copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can create a nightmare when the programmer has to make a change in multiple places. If they don't find all of the areas that the code may need to be chnaged,it most likely will break the application.
